# Dataset: 
I have downloaded the dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement

# Analysis: 
Few questions arise before analysis
1. Which factor influenced a candidate in getting placed?
2. Does percentage matters for one to get placed?
3. Which degree specialization is much demanded by corporate?

So we will try to give the answers of all the questions 
Here is the complete analysis(also check the excel file)

Total students we have are	215,
Placed (148) and
Not Placed (67)

Placed(%)	68.84,
Unplaced(%)	31.16

Lets take a overview on placed and not placed candidates

# so 
1.) If we see marks of Placed students in 10th, 12th, UG, MBA and Placement test are compartively higher than marks of unplaced students.So Marks can be a factor in getting job.												
2.) Secondally out of 141 freshers 84 got the job(place rate=0.59) and out of 74 expreienced 64 got the job(place rate=0.86) so having experience is also adding value.												
3.) Also 148 placed students 95 have the Mkt&Fin(place rate=0.64) and 53 have Mkt&HR(place rate=0.35)  specialisation in MBA so Mkt&Fin is the leader.												

# and 
**70% Commerce and Science student got the job while only 54% Arts student got the job. 
** 12th board is not specifically playing any role in getting job. Both the boards have almost equal place rate(i.e 0.69 for other and 0.67 for Central). 
** Most Placed candidates have Comm&Mgmt degree type(place rate 0.70) then Sci&Tech(place rate 0.69) so this two have similar role.	
**70% student of other board in 10th got the job while 67% student of central board got the job.	
**59% Freshers got the job while 86% experinced got the job. So experience is a plus point.	

# lets do degree specialization analysis

Out of 95 candidates of "Market and HR"  53 got the job while in "market and finance" 95 got the job out of 120. So place rate of Mkt&HR(0.55) is less than that of Mkt&Fin which is 0.79. 	
If we go further Mkt&Fin have more number of Experienced candidates than HR while both have almost equal number of fresher.	
Experienced Placed rate for Mkt&HR is 0.73 and for Mkt&Fin 0.92 which is very high. On the other hand fresher placed rate for Mkt&HR is 0.5 and for Mkt&Fin is 0.69 which is again high. 	
	
So all in all we can say Mkt&Fin candidates are the best suited for job their experinced as well as fresher students both performed well and got higher pay	
	
# MBA	specialization per salary

 Also Market and Finance have the very high payscale than other.
 
 # Gender role
 Does gender make any diffrence in hiring? What data says?
 Hire rate of male is 0.72 and for female is 0.63, both are almost similar hence gender is not making any diffrence in hiring.	
 
 # Final Conclusion and answers of all questions:
 1.) Higher marks(10th,12th, UG, MBA, Placement Test) can make easy in getting hired.									
2.) Max placed students have Market&Finance specialisation in MBA. So this branch is giving more jobs. Also this branch is having comparitively greater salary package than other.									
3.) Since hire rate of experienced candidates is 86% so experience is very important factor in getting jobs.									
4.) Arts students have to struggle.
